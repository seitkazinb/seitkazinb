- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seitkazinb. Former Developer of KCSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Developing and Popularizing Open Source Development in KCSD Organization

# KCSD Open Source Development Handbook

KCSD as a quasi-state organization, didn't have any policy about Development and How to Contribute to Open Source. We want to change this statement, and start to contribute and push some our projects to Open Source.

# How we Develop

We work in cross-functional commands. We work in 2-4 weeks cycles. Simplicity is Key.
